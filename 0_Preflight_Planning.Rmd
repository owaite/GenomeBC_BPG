# Preflight Planning

## Achieving positional accuracy on multi-temporal and multi-sensor data collections 

### Kinematic processing: RTK/PPK 

### Ground Control Points (GCP) 

```{r GCP-figure, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.cap = "Aerial view of a GCP at the 12-year old Western redcedar Sandcut site taken with the P1 sensor."}
knitr::include_graphics("C:\\Users\\owaite\\OneDrive - NRCan RNCan\\Documents\\GitHub\\GenomeBC_BPG\\Photos_&_gifs\\Tree_tops_GCP.png")
```

### Absolute and Relative Reference with Precise Point Positioning (PPP) 

### Terrain Following on Sites with Elevation Change 

```{r terrain-following-figure, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.cap = "Terrain following on variable topography."}
knitr::include_graphics("C:\\Users\\owaite\\OneDrive - NRCan RNCan\\Documents\\GitHub\\GenomeBC_BPG\\Photos_&_gifs\\Terrain_following.PNG")
```

## Site Selection Considerations



*Ideal sites: *

```{r ideal-site-figure, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.cap = ""}
knitr::include_graphics("C:\\Users\\owaite\\OneDrive - NRCan RNCan\\Documents\\GitHub\\GenomeBC_BPG\\Photos_&_gifs\\ideal_sites.png")
```

*Effects of topography: Warning to take extra care *




## Drone and Sensors: What will I need to purchase and how much will it cost?
