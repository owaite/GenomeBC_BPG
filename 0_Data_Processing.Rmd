# Data Processing: Software and hardware costs and options

## Software costs
We chose open-source options where we could, but there are still significant software costs. Table \@ref(tab: software-cost) outlines cost and explores options.

```{r software-cost, echo = FALSE}
data <- data.frame(
  Software  = c("DJI Terra Pro",
                "DJI Terra Pro"
                 
  ),
  Purpose = c(
  ),
  Cost = c(
  ),
  Options_notes = c(
  )
  
  
)
# Create the table and center it
kable(data, col.names = c("Software", "Purpose","Cost","Options - notes"),caption = 'Purpose, cost, and notes on software that we have used for this project.')

```


Data management: Storage needs 

Each project will have very different storage needs, but this will be a rough guide to help plan for the quantity of storage required and can be scaled according to project goals. 

The flight day illustrated in Figure X at the Big Tree GCA site required 110 GB. 

 

One flight per sensor: 

L1 - 2Ha site produces ~510 pictures and approximately 8.5 GB of raw data total. 

P1 - 2Ha flight area produces ~500 photos and 12 GB of data 

MS_P - 2Ha flight area produces around 12,000 photos equaling 42 GB 

MS - 2Ha flight area produces 10,500photos equaling 25GB  

We are keeping all intermediate products while we are developing processes.  Processing more than doubles the raw data.  Consider 250GB a conservative estimate for total data storage needs for the one day on site.

Computer Hardware: 

The computer we are using has the following specifications 

Processor	Intel(R) Xeon(R) Silver 4214R CPU @ 2.40GHz   2.39 GHz  (2 processors) 

Installed RAM	256 GB  

System type	64-bit operating system, x64-based processor 

GPU		NVIDIA RTX A4000Raw Data Collection 

2TB SSD for processing, we have found the processing is consistently faster and less prone to error if we process on the SSD rather than on the storage drives. 

 

For storage we use an 8bay QNAP RAID6 with 12 TB hard drives.  

We use 18Tb HDs for backups.
