# Data Processing: Software and hardware costs and options

## Software costs
We chose open-source options where we could, but there are still significant software costs. Table \@ref(tab: software-cost) outlines cost and explores options.

```{r software-cost, echo = FALSE}
data <- data.frame(
  Software  = c("DJI Terra Pro",
                "DJI Terra Pro"
                 
  ),
  Purpose = c(
  ),
  Cost = c(
  ),
  Options_notes = c(
  )
  
  
)
# Create the table and center it
kable(data, col.names = c("Software", "Purpose","Cost","Options - notes"),caption = 'Purpose, cost, and notes on software that we have used for this project.')

```
